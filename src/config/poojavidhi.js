Place where Pratima is situated should NOT be cleaned with a broomstick. Clean cloth and water can be used to clean the area inside the Chabutras. Existing pooja samagri should be collected in a bag and should not be thrown out randomly. After cleaning a Chabutra completely from outside and inside (Pratima area), move to the next Chabutra and repeat the process. Going from one Chabutra to another has to be done in a particular sequence, as specified in the sketch. It is important to mention here that adjoining the Satimata Chabutra (Badi), there exists Bhairav Baodi (water body of the type 'well'). A small Bhairav or Bahiron idol is clearly visible at the site. Bhairav is considered as gana (karyakarta of Lord Shiva, whose prime duty is to safeguard maa Sati. So, Bhairav idol is also cleaned and a simple Pooja is offered by lighting diya and agarbatti. This should not be considered as a part of the main Satimata Pooja.",
