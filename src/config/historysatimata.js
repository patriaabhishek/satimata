In its nascent stages, the Chabootras stood open from the top, symbolizing an unfiltered communion with the heavens. A pivotal moment in 1990 marked the initiation of transformative efforts by Kailash s/o Bherulal Ji, Narender s/o Hariprasad Ji, Ashok s/o Laduram Ji. Under their stewardship, the main Chabootra emerged, adorned with a roof, pillars, and walls, ushering in an era of enhanced spiritual connectivity. Concurrently, meticulous repair work revitalized the sacred space. A second Chabootra, a testament to devotion, was meticulously crafted by the Bhatt family, adding another layer to the sacred architecture of our temple.",
